# Assessment 3
Welcome to your third Zip Code Wilmington assessment. You have three hours to complete this assessment. There are four sections in this assessment. Feel free to skip around. You may consult Google and your notes. But you may not consult another person.

Be thinking about the train wreck. Break things down into smaller pieces. Google carefully. Pay close attention to your own Lab solutions, you may find you have already solved several of these problems, with only slight modifications. Oftentimes, you'll a pattern you've seen before, but perhaps a little different. Breathe. Be sure you move through the test files, uncommenting, and then removing all the "red lines" by creating classes, methods, etc. Let the tools do some of the work for you.

### Bonus
If you are done before the allotted time, work on the [Java Server](https://git.zipcode.rocks/nhu313/Bonus-Java-Server) lab. It is challenging, but it will help you understand http response and input/output stream better. Enjoy üòù
