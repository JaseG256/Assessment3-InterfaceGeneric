# Part 4 - BubbleSort
The `BubbleSort` class is written for you. There is one test in  `src/test/java/com/zipcoder/assessment3/part4/BubbleSortTest.java`. It is currently failing. Your task is to add more tests to the `BubbleSortTest` test and fix the code so it will pass all your tests. You should at least test the following condition:
1. When the array is null
1. When the array is empty
2. When there is one element
2. When there are two elements and they are in order
2. When there are two elements and they are NOT in order
3. You can change the test written for you.

Note, read the test & code carefully. Does it make sense? Is the result what I expected it to be? Is the code not working or is the test wrong? Or is it both?!?
